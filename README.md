# Highway Lane Detection
Detect traffic and lanes on the highway

This project aims to analyze on-dash camera footage and provides aid to the drivers to improve their control of the car and their understanding of the surrounding environment.
The car lane position and direction from the camera footage will be extracted from the camera footage. Then the camera perspective will be wrapped into the birdâ€™s eye view. Also, the surrounding cars will be detected rom the footage.
